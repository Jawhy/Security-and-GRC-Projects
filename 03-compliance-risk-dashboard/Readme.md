# Compliance Risk Register Dashboard

🔗 **[Live Demo](#)** ← update after deployment

A financial-sector aligned compliance risk register analysis and reporting tool built in Python and Streamlit.

This project simulates the governance reporting workflow used in banking and regulated environments — ingesting a risk register CSV, calculating risk scores, flagging overdue reviews, and generating committee-ready outputs.

## Overview

This tool processes compliance risk registers and produces:

- Risk scoring via Likelihood × Impact matrix (1–25 scale)
- Risk Tier Classification: Low / Medium / High / Critical
- Overdue and due-soon review alerts
- Top 5 critical risks summary
- Interactive risk heatmap, distribution chart, and category breakdown
- Committee-ready Markdown report export
- CSV risk register export
- Live risk entry via sidebar form
- CSV upload for existing risk registers

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Risk Score
```
Risk Score = Likelihood (1–5) × Impact (1–5)
Maximum Score = 25
```

### Risk Tier Thresholds

| Score | Tier |
|-------|------|
| 20–25 | Critical |
| 12–19 | High |
| 6–11  | Medium |
| 1–5   | Low |

The tool accepts any CSV with these column headers:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| risk_id | Unique risk identifier (e.g. R001) |
| risk_title | Short risk description |
| category | Risk category |
| risk_owner | Accountable owner |
| likelihood | Score 1–5 |
| impact | Score 1–5 |
| existing_controls | Controls currently in place |
| remediation_action | Planned remediation steps |
| review_date | Format: YYYY-MM-DD |
| status | Open / In Progress / Closed |
| framework_ref | Applicable framework reference |
